                The main purpose of showcasing this project was the challenge of embedding it and enabling it to be playable within the site
                itself rather than hosting it through a third party like itch.io. Here the game is soley hosted by the site itself.

                This was my University final year project where I aimed to research and prototype a solution that would help solve the
                current issues with NPCs (Non-playable character) reponses that can become predictable and lead to break the player's
                immersion. The solution proposed is an Emotional Component system that can be integrated into the base mechanics of NPCs.
                This system aims to maintain player immersion through simulating accurate reponses to player actions. Rather than 
                instantaneously transitioning from one extreme state to another. The NPC is eased into a response based on their current
                weighted emotions. Extreme responses are possible but require the player to be persistent in their actions towards the NPC.

                The application is a demonstration that is split into two artefacts. Artefact 1 aims to demonstrate NPCs with no Emotional
                Component whereas, Artefact 2 showcases the same NPCs and environment with the Emotional Component integrated within the NPCs.
                There is no established end goal, this application is only a demonstration prototype.

            <h class="subtitles">HOW TO PLAY</h>
            <ul id="tutorial" class="projectText">
                <li>Use the keys W,A,S,D to move.</li>
                <li>Use SPACE or LEFT-SHIFT to sprint.</li>
                <li>Use the LEFT-MOUSE-BUTTON to navigate the various menus and attack objects.</li>
                <li>Use the ESCAPE key to open the pause menu.</li>
                <li>Use the I key to interact with the NPCs when nearby them (NPS will only acknowledge interactions once stationary 
                    near the player).</li>
